1. signs 
-equal sign (==)
-Not equal to (!=)
-greater than(>)
-less than(<)
-greater than or equal to(>=)
-less than or equal to (<=)


2. Operators 
AND (&)
OR(|)


3. R if
-they are commonly used in if statements 
- if statement is used to specify a block of code to be executed if a condition is TRUE
- {} are used to define the scope of a code or function, depending on what you are writing 


```{r}
a <- 30
b <- 220
if (b> a){ 
  print ("b is greater than a")
  }
```

4. else if_ you are telling R if the previous conditions were not met or were not true, then you are telling R to try these other conditions 

```{r}
a <- 30
b <- 30
if (b> a){
  print ("b is greater than a")
} else if (a==b){
  print ("b is equal to a")
}
```

5. If....else - captures anything not captured by if ....and else if
- if...else can work without else if
```{r}
a <- 300
b <- 220

if (b> a){
  print ("b is greater than a")
} else if (a==b){
  print ("b is equal to a")
} else {
  print ("b is less than a ")
}
```

6. AND and OR operators- they are logical operators and are used to combine conditional statements 
```{r}
a <- 30
b <- 220
c <- 400
if(b> a & c> a){
  print ("both conditios are TRUE")
}
```
 OR
 
```{r}
a <- 30
b <- 220
c <- 400
if(b< a | c> a){
  print ("either conditios are TRUE")
}
```
 7. While loop- excutes a statement as longs as the conditions is TRUE
 - print i as long as i <6
```{r}
i <- 1
while(i< 6){
  print (i)
  i<- i+1
}
```
 
- we can combine while loop with if--else function
-print play a game football ifthe player number is 6

```{r}
player <- 1
while (player<= 6) {
  if (player <6){
    print ("No football")
  } else {
    print ("play football")
  }
  player <- player+1
}
```
& For Loop- used to perform iteration
```{r}
for(x in 1:10){
  print(x)
}
```

- nest a if ..else wihyj a for loop

```{r}
dice<- 1:10
for(x in dice){
  if (x==6){
   print(paste("The dice is ", x, "football")) 
  }
  else {
    print(paste("The dice is ", x, "not football")) 
  }
}
```

9. Functions - a function is a block of code that only runs when you call it
- we specify the parameter ( data)
-use function() to create 

```{r}
my_function <- function(){
  print ("Hello")
}
my_function()
```
- function that have argumnet
 -when calling a function; specify the same number argumnets as supplied
 
```{r}
my_function <- function(fname, mname, lname){
  paste (fname,mname, lname)
}
my_function("Brandwell","Muiru", "Mwangi")
```
 
 -installing and using R packages 
 - for installation you need internet
 install. packages("")
```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
#library(tidyverse)
```
